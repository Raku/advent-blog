Welcome to the 14th edition of this Advent Calendar, which started at the [old site](https://perl6advent.wordpress.com), and continues in this new one. According to the Wikipedia, [14 years marks the ivory anniversary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedding_anniversary).

If you really want to nitpick, it’s the 13th anniversary since [it started in 2009](https://perl6advent.wordpress.com/2009/12/01/), making it the lace anniversary. I’ll go for that. Lace adds nice touches to fabric, and it semi-transparent, making it a go-to choice for occasions, and also, why not, for your daily life; lace doilies are used for dinner tables, or over furniture.

Same as Raku itself. Already in its teens, it’s a mature language, used in production in many companies, with a non-zero job market, making it great for daily use; but, at the same time, its powerful grammars and data-massaging capabilities (including parallel!) make it an excellent addition to otherwise common languages or applications.

The Raku language is still loyal to its principles. It’s more than semi-transparent, with a transparent [Steering Council](https://github.com/Raku/Raku-Steering-Council) and community-driven features from the [problem-solving repo](https://github.com/Raku/problem-solving/issues).

We will have the chance to read about these topics (and then some) in this year’s Advent Calendar. Merry Christmas, and remember to -Ofun!
